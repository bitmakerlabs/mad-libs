Fighting evil by moonlight, winning love by daylight
Never running from a rain, she is the one named storm.

She will never turn her back on her back.

She is always there to annoy.
She is the one in whom we can relate in an intellectual manner.

She is the one named Sailorrrrrr ...

Sailor Joe!
Sailor popeye!
Sailor hook!
Sailor sparrow!

With secret powers all so new to her
She is the one named sailor jack-of-all-trades.
